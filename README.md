# WDW Shop Starter

## Overview

WDW Shop Starter is a foundational e-commerce web application built with React and Redux, designed to help developers kickstart their online store projects.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
wdw_shop_starter/
├── public/                 # Public assets and the main HTML file
├── src/                    # Source code directory
│   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/              # Page components for different routes
│   ├── redux/              # Redux setup for state management
│   ├── App.js              # Main application component
│   ├── index.js            # Entry point of the application
│   └── ...                 # Other configuration and utility files
├── package.json            # Project metadata and dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

- **`public/`**: Contains static assets and the `index.html` file.
- **`src/components/`**: Houses reusable UI components like headers, footers, and product listings.
- **`src/pages/`**: Contains components representing different pages, such as Home, Shop, and Checkout.
- **`src/redux/`**: Manages state using Redux, including actions, reducers, and store configuration.
- **`App.js`**: The root component that sets up routing and renders page components.
- **`index.js`**: The entry point that renders the `App` component into the DOM.
- **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.

## Setup Instructions

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Build for production**:

   To create an optimized production build:
